You dropped your cellphone, it was no big deal,” he said. “Now, drop your smartphone on the ground and break it, and you will feel a separation like no other.”\\n\\nJust as today’s smartphones have both shuttered and built entire industries, AI is going to change sales, Guthrie said. “But is it going to make everyone obsolete? I don’t think so.”\\n\\nMore importantly, he said, even the most advanced AI can’t replicate the most irreplaceable, intangible component of any sale: chemistry between buyer and seller.\\n\\n“Selling is all about building relationships,” Guthrie said. “I always say you buy from people you like. You don’t buy from people you hate. Yes, there are going to be products where you can just click and buy, but when it comes to important decisions, especially in business, you want to look at somebody in the eye, you want to shake their hand, and you want to build a relationship.”\\n\\n“You want to know that person understands your business, and is looking to help you solve a business problem, and I think that requires a level of human connection that no machine can ever do,” he continued.\\n\\nNot every sales executive who shared the stage with Guthrie at the Future of Sales in Canada shared his optimism about the impact of AI on jobs, however: PointClickCare senior vice president of sales Joan Leroux told ITBusiness.ca that she believes today’s aspiring salespeople need to be “pragmatic” when it comes to thinking about the sector’s future.\\n\\n“As in many industries, we have seen technology advancements really disintermediate those high-volume/low-value transactions and solve low-level situations with consumers,” she said – both situations which had introduced many to the industry.\\n\\nAdding technology to the mix forces salespeople to work smarter, Leroux said, as it has in many industries, though she noted that in her experience it’s embraced equally warmly both by sales teams and the executives leading them.\\n\\n“As sales professionals, technology is giving us an opportunity to better engage with our customers in a more strategic capacity, so that we can improve their buying decisions, and improve our competitive advantage,” she said.\\n\\nHaving a diverse sales team doesn’t hurt either, she added.',\n",

Yes, there are going to be products where you can just click and buy, but when it comes to important decisions, especially in business, you want to look at somebody in the eye, you want to shake their hand, and you want to build a relationship.”\\n\\n“You want to know that person understands your business, and is looking to help you solve a business problem, and I think that requires a level of human connection that no machine can ever do,” he continued.\\n\\nNot every sales executive who shared the stage with Guthrie at the Future of Sales in Canada shared his optimism about the impact of AI on jobs, however: PointClickCare senior vice president of sales Joan Leroux told CDN that she believes today’s aspiring salespeople need to be “pragmatic” when it comes to thinking about the sector’s future.\\n\\n“As in many industries, we have seen technology advancements really disintermediate those high-volume/low-value transactions and solve low-level situations with consumers,” she said – both situations which had introduced many to the industry.\\n\\nAdding technology to the mix forces salespeople to work smarter, Leroux said, as it has in many industries, though she noted that in her experience it’s embraced equally warmly both by sales teams and the executives leading them.\\n\\n“As sales professionals, technology is giving us an opportunity to better engage with our customers in a more strategic capacity, so that we can improve their buying decisions, and improve our competitive advantage,” she said.',\n",

              " 14: \"Among the dozens of cloud computing companies, Athenahealth Inc. (Nasdaq: ATHN) might not seem like an obvious top stock to buy.\\n\\nBut investors lured to the big tech firms of Silicon Valley are missing one of the most compelling plays in this rapidly growing sector.\\n\\nEditor's Pick: The Best Stocks to Buy to Cash In on 5G's $1.3 Trillion Opportunity\\n\\nAthenahealth sells software-based cloud solutions to 114,000 healthcare providers, including hospitals, pharmacies, labs, and practices. The goal is to automate and simplify record-keeping to make providers more efficient.\\n\\nATHN is entirely focused on the healthcare cloud solutions for these providers and doesn't have a lot of exposure to the public. That's why you may not be familiar with it.\\n\\nBut unlike many of the companies most often mentioned as top cloud computing stocks – Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO), Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) – Athenahealth is a pure play.\\n\\nIt gets all or nearly all of its revenue from the cloud, as opposed to just a portion of it as those big names do.\\n\\nAnd the pure plays stand to profit the most from the explosive growth in cloud services expected over the next few years.\\n\\nTake a look at these numbers…\\n\\nWhy Cloud Computing Stocks Are in a Sweet Spot\\n\\nCloud computing stocks already have an impressive track record of growth.\\n\\nBessemer Venture Partners, a tech-focused venture capital firm, created an index to measure the performance of 50 top cloud stocks.\\n\\nSince January 2011 the BVP Cloud Index (which includes Athenahealth) is up 592%, quadrupling the S&P 500's gain of 121%.\\n\\nDon't Miss: This secret stock-picking method has uncovered 217 double- and triple-digit peak-gain winners since 2011. Find out how it's done…\\n\\nAnd forecasts for the cloud computing market suggest this kind of growth won't slow down any time soon.\\n\\nThe area of healthcare cloud computing, the segment in which Athenahealth operates, looks especially promising.\\n\\nAccording to BCC Research, the market in North America for healthcare cloud computing will more than double from $4.9 billion in 2016 to $10.2 billion by 2022. Athenaheath operates exclusively in the United States.\\n\\nThis represents a lot of opportunity for Athenahealth in its home market, and even more if it decides to branch out beyond the United States.\\n\\nAnd the company is well-positioned now to take advantage of this opportunity, despite some negative noise over the past year…\\n\\nWhy Wall Street Is Down on Athenahealth Stock\\n\\nAs a medtech company, Athenahealth has struggled to bring change to an industry resistant to technological disruption. Since 2014 the business has foundered, with ATHN stock going mostly sideways.\\n\\nAfter peaking at just over $200 a share in February 2014, Athenahealth stock has zigzagged. It fell as low as $96 in December 2016 before recovering to $150 last summer. Today, ATHN stock trades at $160.90.\\n\\nThat's frustrated Wall Street. Private equity company Elliott Management, which bought a 9.2% stake in Athenahealth in May 2017, has tried to buy out the company several times. Athenahealth management has rejected the offers, including the most recent one this past May of $160 a share.\\n\\nThe company instead started to reorganize under CEO Jonathan Bush, who founded Athenahealth in 1997 to better exploit the growing market for its products.\\n\\nBut Bush – who happens to be the nephew of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush – was forced out earlier this month following allegations of physical abuse of his ex-wife and improper behavior toward female employees.\\n\\nThose recent struggles have helped keep a lid on ATHN stock, despite being well positioned in the fast-growing cloud computing sector.\\n\\nAnd the focus on the past doesn't give enough weight to the changes the company is making to exploit the vast potential before it.\\n\\nOne of the best clues we have that ATHN is a top stock to buy is its Money Morning VQScore™ of 4 – the highest possible score.\\n\\nAnd there's plenty of evidence to back that up…\\n\\nWhy ATHN Is a Top Stock to Buy\",\n",
              " 15: 'There is a growing shift to self-employment — more people are trading in their W-2 forms for 1099s.\\n\\nSome 57.3 million Americans, or 36% of the workforce, are freelancing and contributing approximately $1.4 trillion annually to the economy, according to a research study by Upwork and the Freelancers Union titled “Freelancing in America: 2017.” The report found that the freelance workforce grew three times as fast as the overall workforce. Freelancers will make up the majority of America’s workforce by 2027, based on growth rates seen in the past year. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service shows sole proprietorship registrations growing at an average rate of 1.6% a year (not counting the 2008 financial crisis), and rising one basis point every year for the past three years ending 2016 (the latest year that data is available).\\n\\nSource: “Freelancing in America”\\n\\nAs the ranks of the self-employed swell there is a need for more services, everything from credit-card processing to tax filing, that help these individuals manage their own businesses. And companies like Intuit, Salesforce and Square are poised to benefit from this need.\\n\\nIntuit\\n\\nIntuit, Inc. (INTU) has been making an effort to target the self-employed for the past four years. The company noticed customers of its Mint app wanting to separate personal expenses from their business expenses in 2013, according to Jeremy Sulzmann, director of QuickBooks Self-Employed at Intuit. So, in 2014, the firm launched QuickBooks Self-Employed.\\n\\n“We decided to create a product to help people keep better track of those expenses, help them remain compliant and save on taxes,” said Sulzmann. “We do see that there’s a growing section of the market of self-employed and we add a ton of value to them.”\\n\\nQuickBooks Self-Employed, one of Intuit’s fastest-growing products, now has more than 700,000 users. Intuit’s small business and self-employed business segment, which has a customer base of 5 million, recently posted quarterly revenue growth of 18% from a year ago, Intuit highlighted the business segment’s bump in its 2018 fiscal fourth quarter earnings release. Intuit estimates the self-employed workforce in the U.S. will grow to 43% by 2020.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\n“Our biggest competition is people doing nothing at all, like keeping their receipts in a shoebox,” said Sulzmann. “It’s those people who don’t know there’s a tool out there that can help them be more compliant, efficient and save money.”\\n\\nSalesforce\\n\\nEarlier this year Salesforce, Inc. (CRM) launched Salesforce Essentials, geared to small businesses. It was created to help small business owners become more productive and to help them grow faster, according to Meredith Schmidt, executive vice president and general manager of Salesforce Essentials and SMB.\\n\\n“It is uniquely tailored for small businesses, and helps them save time with apps that are easy to set up and use.” said Schmidt. Salesforce Essentials provides small business owners access to its premium apps like Trailhead, Einstein AI, Lightning and AppExchange, that are offered to its bigger corporate clients.\\n\\nIn a testimonial blog post, Y’vonne Ormond, who left a 20-year career as a software engineer in enterprise-size organizations to start her own technology consulting firm, 5P Consulting, said Salesforce Essentials increased her company’s productivity tenfold. “It has given us a cost-effective way to operate like a larger organization at the scale of a small business,” she said.\\n\\nSquare\\n\\nSquare, Inc. (SQ) provides hardware and software that turns mobile phones and tablets into point-of-sales systems. In 2017, Square was one of the top payment tool apps for freelancers, according to Medium. The company’s second-quarter revenue for its hardware (Square Register, Square Stand and Square Reader) was up 78% from the same period a year ago.\\n\\n“We’re empowering the electrician to send invoices, setting up the food truck with a delivery option, helping the clothing boutique pay its employees, and giving the coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location,” said Square on its homepage.\\n\\nSquare has also partnered with Intuit to better cater to the self-employed. Transactions conducted on Square are automatically synchronized with Intuit’s QuickBooks so there’s no need for users to input data and processing fees can be viewed separately.\\n\\n“Square is complementary to serve Intuit’s customers,” said Intuit’s Sulzmann. “We work in partnership with the whole ecosystem to empower the self-employed workers.”\\n\\nMaylan Studart is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.',\n",

Barclays\\'s rent is 13 per cent more than the most recent estimate for the property, Green Reit Plc, which owns the building, said last week.\\n\\nStoked by demand from finance, technology and legal firms, rising prices are helping push office construction back to Celtic Tiger levels.\\n\\nStay updated with\\n\\nBT newsletters Terms & conditions Sign up\\n\\nThen, the boom collapsed, devastating the economy. A decade on, the market is being closely watched for signs of overheating. \"It\\'s inevitable that when we have an upswing in the cycle, construction gets going and generally overreaches itself, so that when there\\'s a downturn, there tends to be an oversupply,\" said Tom Dunne, a real-estate lecturer at the Dublin Institute of Technology. \"So what we\\'re really talking about is the extent of that oversupply, and that\\'s really difficult to predict.\"\\n\\nMore than four million square feet of offices are under construction around Dublin, according to real estate broker HWBC, in a market increasingly underpinned by technology giants.\\n\\nFacebook is in talks to take over a campus development in the south city of about 450,000 square feet, while Alphabet\\'s Google has agreed terms for 234,000 square feet in the city\\'s docklands, the biggest single deal in the first half of this year.\\n\\nSalesforce Inc is in talks to lease dockland offices with space for as many as 5,000 workers, the Irish Independent has reported.\\n\\n\"In absolute terms, yes construction now is comparable to the previous boom, but in proportion to the size of the overall market, it is much smaller,\" Colm Lauder, an analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, said. \"We\\'re adding about 15 per cent to the size of the market in net terms when you take into account offices being replaced or refurbished,\" he said. \"Between 2004 and 2007, the market grew by about 50 per cent, so in relative terms, it\\'s much smaller.\"\\n\\nAfter the 2008 crash, top Dublin office rents fell by as much as 55 per cent.

It is a pivotal year for enterprise technology, with regulators, lawmakers and customers reassessing the roles and responsibilities of companies that are entrusted with the public’s data.\\n\\nOn Sunday, the Symposium featured a keynote by Obama-era U.S. CTO Megan Smith, now CEO of shift7, a digital experience agency. Ms. Smith addressed the possibility of using technology in a more constructive manner, starting with a focus on diversity and inclusion. “We can community organize ourselves into the future … We have done this in America, upgraded ourselves. Let’s do that with tech,” Ms. Smith said.\\n\\nShe challenged the audience to bridge innovator activities such as mentorships and startups with big companies that need to find new ways of doing things. Ms. Smith cited the use of bookclub-like programs all across the country, to teach people how to code. “We think it’s in our pipeline in kindergarten, but it’s not. It’s our culture,” Ms. Smith said, adding it was time to “raise the floor on diversity and inclusion.” It’s one element of a far-reaching global reckoning for all companies that are custodians of technology and data.\\n\\nAutomation and the changing demand for workforce skills. Jobs will keep changing through the automation of some of their constituent activities, says CIO Journal Columnist Irving Wladawsky-Berger. Jobs that once required highly skilled, hard-to-find talent will become available to mid-skill workers thanks to advanced tools.\\n\\nFACIAL RECOGNITION\\n\\nFacebook fights data-scrapers. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook is taking steps against an ecoystem of startups intent on exploiting its troves of personal data. The company on Thursday banned two Russian firms for scraping data, including photos, from its website, the New York Times reports. One of the companies, Fubutech, creates facial-recognition software for the Russian government, says the NYT.\\n\\nFacial recognition for animals. All creatures, great and small, are looking into the camera. Facial recognition is now being used to monitor the health and relative happiness of livestock such as cows, pigs and sheep, New York Magazine reports. Adventurous technologists, motivated by a desire to save disappearing wildlife, are bringing facial recognition to tigers and lions to track their populations in real time.\\n\\nTECH ECONOMICS\\n\\nIn China, a dot-com déjà-vu. For the first time, Chinese startups are getting more money than their U.S. counterparts—$71 billion versus $70 billion so far this year, VentureSource data shows. The pace, with investment volume 18 times what it was five years ago, hasn’t been seen since the 2000 tech-stock bubble. But all good things, etc., etc. The WSJ\\'s Phred Dvorak and Liza Lin report that there are already signs of a shake-out.\\n\\nThe SoftBank effect on tech IPOs. Since its launch last year, the company\\'s tech-focused Vision Fund has shaken up the venture capital industry, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, into startups. The Journal\\'s Eliot Brown and Mayumi Negishi note that Silicon Valley investors are now saying that “SoftBank is the new IPO,” while some have dubbed a SoftBank investment the “Masa-PO,” named after SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son.\\n\\nHarris, L3 Technologies announce merger plan. The defense industry merger would unite two companies with a combined market value of about $33.5 billion and a product range stretching from military radios and top-secret space hardware to air-traffic-control systems.

The company \"ushered concepts long confined to econ 101 into the popular discourse,\" by creating a new market defined by supply and demand--hello surge pricing. Quartz reports that the Uber has its own team of economists and their collaborations with some of the biggest names in the field are starting to make waves.\\n\\nMORE TECH NEWS\\n\\nFacebook share more details on huge hack. Facebook Inc. on Friday gave more details on its largest-ever security breach, where hackers “exploited a vulnerability” in its computer code, starting in July 2017. Facebook discovered the attack Sept. 25 and stopped it two days later. The Journal\\'s Kirsten Grind has more.\\n\\nGood(ish) news.

Hurricane Michael has caused such extensive damage to the fiber that underpins Verizon Communications Inc.’s wireless network that it has stymied the carrier’s efforts to restore service to parts of the hardest-hit areas of the Florida Panhandle. The WSJ\\'s Sarah Krouse reports that Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, had aerial and underground fiber in the area damaged by Michael.\\n\\nIndia\\'s data-localization drive attracts senators\\' attention.

Here’s a snapshot: One leads a dominant software brand that enables thousands of companies and millions of people worldwide to avoid a range of cyberthreats. Another high-powered executive has unveiled the next generation in mobile technology that will dramatically change the way we work, live, and conduct business. One entrepreneur has built a company that uses innovation to bring renewable energy to countries and could provide the answer to sustainability for a continent—and the world. And another CEO runs a publicly traded company that helps police departments detect and analyze gunshots as a means of reducing urban violence.\\n\\nThe aforementioned disruptors and more than a score of others represent a phalanx of CEOs, founders of ground-breaking enterprises, and corporate leaders who help drive the strategic direction at some of America’s most iconic tech companies. In the process, they impact a range of sectors, including financial services, manufacturing, food services, and entertainment to name but a few. Those found on our roster represent the following:\\n\\n-Leaders who oversee, operate, and guide the strategic direction of publicly traded and privately held high-impact tech companies\\n\\n-Top executives on leadership teams overseeing overall management, operations, product development, and corporate strategy\\n\\n-Individuals who have engaged in driving digital transformation for their companies and customers\\n\\nAs such, we decided not to include core investors, venture capitalists, and corporate board members who play no other role within the tech space.\\n\\nWe have identified those on our list by consulting leaders, executives, experts, and consultants within and outside Silicon Valley.\\n\\nStill trying to figure out the names of the four who we included as part of our opening snapshots? Read on to find these amazing leaders and others who comprise our list of Top Tech Influencers.\\n\\n-—Reporting by Lisa Fraser, Roland Michel, Delicia Paisley-Smith and Tiamari Whitted\\n\\nThe 2018 List of the Most Influential Blacks in Technology\\n\\nTop CEOs\\n\\nRalph A. Clark\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nShotSpotter Inc.\\n\\nIf you can identify technology that has helped reduce gun violence, police departments from Chicago to New York will point to ShotSpotter Inc. Ralph A. Clark, the company’s president and CEO, has been responsible for making the company the leader in gunshot detection, location, and forensic analysis. And most recently, he expanded the company’s portfolio with the acquisition of HunchLab technology from Philadelphia-based Azavea, which will enable the company to apply risk modeling and AI to help forecast when and where crimes are likely to occur and provide deterrence recommendations for specific patrol missions.\\n\\nClark’s 30 years of corporate, financial, and organizational leadership has led to the company’s superior performance. His previous positions include serving as president and CEO at GuardianEdge Technologies Inc., leading its transformation into a leader in endpoint data protection before helping orchestrate its acquisition by Symantec, and chief financial officer at Snap Appliance Inc. Prior to his role at Snap Appliance, he worked at several VC-backed startups, leading a number of them to successful acquisitions. Early in his career, Clark, who holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of the Pacific, and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, excelled in sales and marketing roles at IBM as well as served as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs & Co. L.L.C. and Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., handling transactions involving tech companies.\\n\\nMarc Jones\\n\\nChairman and CEO\\n\\nAeris\\n\\nOn the cutting edge of technology as chairman and CEO of Aeris, Marc Jones has led his team over the past decade to help power the world’s largest companies through the Internet of Things (IoT). Named by Goldman Sachs as one of the nation’s leading entrepreneurs in 2012 and 2013, Jones grew up in Chicago before heading west to Stanford University, where he received both his undergraduate and law degrees. As a young attorney, he was recruited by top-tier investment banks and then by some of his clients. In his early 30s, he was named president and COO of Madge Networks, where he helped turn the upstart network solutions company with $40 million in revenue into an industry leader producing revenue of $500 million. Madge’s initial public offering was successfully executed on Jones’ watch. After Madge, Jones served as the chairman and CEO of Visionael, a pioneer in enterprise network management and automation, raising over $40 million to fuel its rapid growth. In addition to his professional work, he serves as the chair of Management Leadership for Tomorrow and a board member of the California Health Care Foundation and a trustee for Stanford University.\\n\\nEric Kelly\\n\\nChairman & CEO\\n\\nSphere 3D Corp.\\n\\nA Silicon Valley heavyweight for more than three decades, Eric Kelly serves as chairman and CEO of Sphere 3D Corp., which delivers containerization, virtualization, and data management solutions via hybrid cloud, cloud, and on-premise implementations through its global reseller network and professional services organization. He has served as Sphere 3D’s chairman since July 2013, and gained the CEO position in 2014, after its merger with Overland Storage, the enterprise he helmed five years prior to the transaction. Under his leadership, net revenues of the publicly traded company increased to $81.5 million for FY 2017 and its portfolio of brands expanded to provide solutions for the healthcare, education, government, and financial services sectors.\\n\\nHis previous positions have included vice president and general manager of Storage Systems Solutions at Adaptec Inc.; president and CEO of Snap Appliance; president of the Systems Division at Maxtor Corp., as well as various executive-level roles with Dell Computer Corp., Diamond Multimedia, Conner Peripherals, and IBM.\\n\\nHis business acumen placed him in high demand in business and government circles. In fact, Kelly, who earned an M.B.A. from San Francisco State University and a B.S. in Business from San Jose State University, served two terms on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Manufacturing Council, providing counsel to the Obama administration on strategies and policy recommendations to promote and advance domestic manufacturing.\\n\\nFrançois Locoh-Donou\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nF5 Networks Inc.\\n\\nHaving lived in the West African nation of Togo and France, François Locoh-Donou brings a unique global perspective to his leadership of Seattle-based F5 Networks Inc. Named president, chief executive officer, and a member of the board of directors in April 2017, he brought two decades of enterprise technology experience to the company, which specializes in application delivery networking technology. His prowess delivered record revenue for the publicly traded company of $2.1 billion in 2017.\\n\\nLocoh-Donou previously held successive leadership positions at Ciena, the network strategy and technology company, including chief operating officer; senior vice president, Global Products Group; vice president and general manager, EMEA; vice president, International Sales; and vice president, Marketing. Prior to joining Ciena, he held R&D roles at Photonetics, a French optoelectronics company.\\n\\nLocoh-Donou, who received his bachelor’s and master’s in physics engineering at École Centrale de Marseille; a master’s in optical communications from Télécom Paris Tech, and his M.B.A. from Stanford, serves on the advisory board of Jhpiego, a nonprofit global health affiliate of Johns Hopkins University. He is also the co-founder of Cajou Espoir, a cashew-processing facility that employs several hundred people in rural Togo, 80% of whom are women. Cajou Espoir exports more than 400 tons of cashew kernels annually to the U.S. and Europe.\\n\\nCharles E. Phillips\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nInfor Inc.\\n\\nCharles E. Phillips has built Infor Inc. into a multinational tech powerhouse. As CEO of one of the world’s largest providers of enterprise software applications since 2010, he has been responsible for doubling the company’s revenue to $2.7 billion and size to more than 15,000 employees. It also became the first major software company to offer an integrated, end-to-end application suite for entire industries: the first Industry Cloud Company. Due to this phenomenal growth, Koch Equity Development, a division of Koch Industries, made a $2.5 billion investment in the firm last year.\\n\\nPhillips, who was named one of BE’s Most Powerful Executives in Corporate America has spent his career transforming companies with technology, industry domain, and unconstrained thinking. As such, the former captain in the Marine Corps.—who rose to become a managing director at Morgan Stanley and co-president and director of Oracle—has been highly sought after for service on boards, including Viacom Corp., Banco Santander, Apollo Theater, Business Executives for National Security, and Jazz at Lincoln Center. Phillips, who holds a bachelor’s degree from the Air Force Academy, an M.B.A. from Hampton University, and a law degree from New York University, serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and was a member of the President’s Economic Advisory Board during the Obama administration.\\n\\nCorey E. Thomas\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nRapid7\\n\\nRapid7 is one of the go-to companies for major corporations that seek to detect and respond to cyberattacks. Due to the leadership of Corey E. Thomas, its president and CEO, that reputation is well deserved. In fact, the Rapid7 Insight platform collects data from across a given company’s environment to enable teams to manage weaknesses, monitor user behavior, search logs, and other functions. It handles such services for more than 7,000 organizations—including Microsoft, Macy’s, Netflix, and Intuit—in more than 120 countries.\\n\\nThomas is one of the leading experts in this arena: In 2018, he was elected to the Cyber Threat Alliance board of directors and the Massachusetts Cybersecurity Strategy Council.\\n\\nHaving received a bachelor’s in electrical engineering and computer science from Vanderbilt University and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, Thomas has led an array of tech companies to the next stage of innovation. Before joining Rapid7, he was vice president of marketing at Parallels Inc., a virtualization technology company; and group project manager of Microsoft’s Server and Tools division, launching the worldwide availability of SQL Server 2005 and steering product planning for its data platform.\\n\\nTop Entrepreneurs\\n\\nChris Young\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nMcAfee L.L.C.\\n\\nIn an era of cyberthreats, Christopher Young seeks to make the world more secure. As chief executive officer of McAfee L.L.C., he drives the company’s security business across hardware and software platforms and as a result, the firm generated 2017 revenues exceeding $3 billion. Through his leadership, McAfee protects mission-critical systems and data for a myriad of the world’s largest publicly traded corporations. Moreover, vast arrays of government agencies and non-governmental organizations as well as more than 400 million consumers rely on its cybersecurity solutions.\\n\\nYoung’s expertise has been tapped at the highest levels of government and business. For instance, he serves as a member of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), which advises the U.S. government on national security and emergency preparedness. He also played a key role in the establishment and governance of the nonprofit Cyber Threat Alliance—a group of companies that share intelligence in this area.\\n\\nHe can also be found on the boards of American Express and Snap Inc. Moreover, the Harvard M.B.A. served on the board of trustees of Princeton University, his alma mater.\\n\\nJessica O. Matthews\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nUncharted Power\\n\\nFor years, Jessica Matthews has held a true passion for helping countries within the African continent. At the age of 22, the Nigerian-American innovator and entrepreneur created SOCCKET, a soccer ball that produced kinetic energy during play that could be used to power a lamp, cell phone, or other devices. The invention proved invaluable to Nigeria and other countries challenged by sporadic blackouts.\\n\\nRoughly a decade later, that one invention has grown into Uncharted Power, “an energy and data technology firm that produces infrastructure solutions for communities, facilities, and the Internet of Things (IoT).” As such, it has developed an array of kinetic energy-generating vehicles like MORE (Motion-based, Off-grid Renewable Energy) and the energy-harnessing Pulse jump rope to serve major corporations and governments in Nigeria, Angola, Malawi, and Senegal, among others. The company has more than 10-plus global patents that are either finalized or pending,\\n\\nIn 2016, Matthews became the first black woman to raise $7 million in a Series A financing, which was led by the NIC Fund with participation from Kapor Capital, Magic Johnson Enterprises, BBG Ventures, and Lingo Ventures. The Harvard grad has won over 25 awards, including being named the Black Enterprise Innovator of the year in 2013.\\n\\nCharley Moore\\n\\nCEO & Founder\\n\\nRocket Lawyer\\n\\nCharley Moore was seeking to solve a huge problem for small businesses: an online service that would provide entrepreneurs with legal advice on an accessible and affordable platform. When he launched San Francisco-based Rocket Lawyer, Moore took a risk with his company in the beginning by offering free services. The move paid off: His venture went from 25,000 subscribers to over 1 million users. The company was growing so rapidly that the staff increased from 50 employees to 100 employees.\\n\\nMoore, a former internet law and business attorney for high-power Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, received $40 million in venture funding from August Capital, Google Ventures (now GV), and Investor Growth Capital between 2009 and 2013 to finance the infrastructure and operations.

As co-founder of the Virtual Reality Studio, his company announced that it raised $23 million to produce original virtual reality content and position VRC as the premier VR storyteller and industry lead. And VRC continues to break new ground. Earlier this year, it announced its deal with Universal Studios and entertainment colossus Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, launching “Jurassic World VR Expedition, an interactive cinematic virtual reality (VR) game that transports players to the visually stunning jungles of Isla Nublar, where fans will engage in an epic rescue adventure inspired by the Jurassic World film series.” The game was unveiled in June at more than 100 Dave & Buster’s entertainment centers—and as Variety reported in September, the biggest location-based VR debut ever. Moreover, VRC’s deal has been cited as “one of the most successful commercial VR partnerships for a major motion picture studio to date.” Primus told Variety: “This will be the first time that a studio receives a 7-figure check for VR.”\\n\\nPrimus will continue to engage in similar partnerships with companies like motion seat maker D-Box Technologies, which helped introduce the company’s first original VR experience, an animated series, Raising a Rukus, as well as scout other family-friendly fare. His previous experience in senior-level roles such as COO of Overbrook Entertainment, director of Digital Media for Starbucks Entertainment, and group product manager at Microsoft has positioned him for such game-changing moves. Primus, who received his bachelor’s and master’s in industrial engineering from Georgia Tech and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, will stay plugged into the latest tech developments: He’s also the chairman emeritus of the advisory board of top-ranked School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at his alma mater.\\n\\nDavid L.

With $10.7 billion in 2017 revenues, WWT is the nation’s largest black-owned company and one of the biggest minority suppliers in the country.\\n\\nMaintaining that WWT is headquartered in “Silicon Valley in St. Louis,” Steward recently announced his company’s inclusion in Gartner’s August 2018 Market Guide for Digital Business Consulting Services “as one of the 20 Representative Vendors in DBCS across digital strategy, digital customer, and employee experience, and digital business model transformation.” To better serve customers, WWT created the Advanced Technology Center, a brick-and-mortar campus containing labs used for product demonstrations, proofs of concept, building reference architectures, and so much more.\\n\\nThe Clinton, Missouri, native started his career in sales before launching WWT with less than 10 employees—now, WWT has 4,000-plus employees.

Synergies, however, are readily apparent as Ikea promotes the fact that Taskers are on hand to provide furniture assembly, among other services.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Brown-Philpot never envisioned being a part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

Ralph A. Clark, the company’s president and CEO, has been responsible for making the company the leader in gunshot detection, location, and forensic analysis. And most recently, he expanded the company’s portfolio with the acquisition of HunchLab technology from Philadelphia-based Azavea, which will enable the company to apply risk modeling and AI to help forecast when and where crimes are likely to occur and provide deterrence recommendations for specific patrol missions.\\n\\nClark’s 30 years of corporate, financial, and organizational leadership has led to the company’s superior performance.

Named by Goldman Sachs as one of the nation’s leading entrepreneurs in 2012 and 2013, Jones grew up in Chicago before heading west to Stanford University, where he received both his undergraduate and law degrees. As a young attorney, he was recruited by top-tier investment banks and then by some of his clients. In his early 30s, he was named president and COO of Madge Networks, where he helped turn the upstart network solutions company with $40 million in revenue into an industry leader producing revenue of $500 million. Madge’s initial public offering was successfully executed on Jones’ watch. After Madge, Jones served as the chairman and CEO of Visionael, a pioneer in enterprise network management and automation, raising over $40 million to fuel its rapid growth. In addition to his professional work, he serves as the chair of Management Leadership for Tomorrow and a board member of the California Health Care Foundation and a trustee for Stanford University.\\n\\nEric Kelly\\n\\nChairman & CEO\\n\\nSphere 3D Corp.\\n\\nA Silicon Valley heavyweight for more than three decades, Eric Kelly serves as chairman and CEO of Sphere 3D Corp., which delivers containerization, virtualization, and data management solutions via hybrid cloud, cloud, and on-premise implementations through its global reseller network and professional services organization.

As such, the former captain in the Marine Corps.—who rose to become a managing director at Morgan Stanley and co-president and director of Oracle—has been highly sought after for service on boards, including Viacom Corp., Banco Santander, Apollo Theater, Business Executives for National Security, and Jazz at Lincoln Center. Phillips, who holds a bachelor’s degree from the Air Force Academy, an M.B.A. from Hampton University, and a law degree from New York University, serves as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and was a member of the President’s Economic Advisory Board during the Obama administration.\\n\\nCorey E. Thomas\\n\\nPresident & CEO\\n\\nRapid7\\n\\nRapid7 is one of the go-to companies for major corporations that seek to detect and respond to cyberattacks. Due to the leadership of Corey E. Thomas, its president and CEO, that reputation is well deserved. In fact, the Rapid7 Insight platform collects data from across a given company’s environment to enable teams to manage weaknesses, monitor user behavior, search logs, and other functions. It handles such services for more than 7,000 organizations—including Microsoft, Macy’s, Netflix, and Intuit—in more than 120 countries.\\n\\nThomas is one of the leading experts in this arena: In 2018, he was elected to the Cyber Threat Alliance board of directors and the Massachusetts Cybersecurity Strategy Council.\\n\\nHaving received a bachelor’s in electrical engineering and computer science from Vanderbilt University and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, Thomas has led an array of tech companies to the next stage of innovation.

For instance, he serves as a member of the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), which advises the U.S. government on national security and emergency preparedness. He also played a key role in the establishment and governance of the nonprofit Cyber Threat Alliance—a group of companies that share intelligence in this area.\\n\\nHe can also be found on the boards of American Express and Snap Inc. Moreover, the Harvard M.B.A. served on the board of trustees of Princeton University, his alma mater.\\n\\nJessica O. Matthews\\n\\nCEO\\n\\nUncharted Power\\n\\nFor years, Jessica Matthews has held a true passion for helping countries within the African continent. At the age of 22, the Nigerian-American innovator and entrepreneur created SOCCKET, a soccer ball that produced kinetic energy during play that could be used to power a lamp, cell phone, or other devices. The invention proved invaluable to Nigeria and other countries challenged by sporadic blackouts.\\n\\nRoughly a decade later, that one invention has grown into Uncharted Power, “an energy and data technology firm that produces infrastructure solutions for communities, facilities, and the Internet of Things (IoT).” As such, it has developed an array of kinetic energy-generating vehicles like MORE (Motion-based, Off-grid Renewable Energy) and the energy-harnessing Pulse jump rope to serve major corporations and governments in Nigeria, Angola, Malawi, and Senegal, among others. The company has more than 10-plus global patents that are either finalized or pending,\\n\\nIn 2016, Matthews became the first black woman to raise $7 million in a Series A financing, which was led by the NIC Fund with participation from Kapor Capital, Magic Johnson Enterprises, BBG Ventures, and Lingo Ventures. The Harvard grad has won over 25 awards, including being named the Black Enterprise Innovator of the year in 2013.\\n\\nCharley Moore\\n\\nCEO & Founder\\n\\nRocket Lawyer\\n\\nCharley Moore was seeking to solve a huge problem for small businesses: an online service that would provide entrepreneurs with legal advice on an accessible and affordable platform. When he launched San Francisco-based Rocket Lawyer, Moore took a risk with his company in the beginning by offering free services. The move paid off: His venture went from 25,000 subscribers to over 1 million users. The company was growing so rapidly that the staff increased from 50 employees to 100 employees.\\n\\nMoore, a former internet law and business attorney for high-power Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, received $40 million in venture funding from August Capital, Google Ventures (now GV), and Investor Growth Capital between 2009 and 2013 to finance the infrastructure and operations. Today, the United States Naval Academy and University of California at Berkeley law school graduate has transformed Rocket Lawyer into an evolving, global operation that has helped more than 20 million people with their legal issues, ranging from business incorporations to estate planning as well as created more than 100,000 business contracts a month. Rocket Lawyer has also been ranked among the be 100s, the nation’s largest black-owned businesses.\\n\\nGuy Primus\\n\\nCEO & Founder\\n\\nThe Virtual Reality Co.\\n\\nWhen BE wrote about Guy Primus in 2016, we reported that this innovative entrepreneur represents one of the few African Americans (perhaps the only) heading up a virtual reality content studio. As co-founder of the Virtual Reality Studio, his company announced that it raised $23 million to produce original virtual reality content and position VRC as the premier VR storyteller and industry lead. And VRC continues to break new ground. Earlier this year, it announced its deal with Universal Studios and entertainment colossus Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, launching “Jurassic World VR Expedition, an interactive cinematic virtual reality (VR) game that transports players to the visually stunning jungles of Isla Nublar, where fans will engage in an epic rescue adventure inspired by the Jurassic World film series.” The game was unveiled in June at more than 100 Dave & Buster’s entertainment centers—and as Variety reported in September, the biggest location-based VR debut ever. Moreover, VRC’s deal has been cited as “one of the most successful commercial VR partnerships for a major motion picture studio to date.” Primus told Variety: “This will be the first time that a studio receives a 7-figure check for VR.”\\n\\nPrimus will continue to engage in similar partnerships with companies like motion seat maker D-Box Technologies, which helped introduce the company’s first original VR experience, an animated series, Raising a Rukus, as well as scout other family-friendly fare. His previous experience in senior-level roles such as COO of Overbrook Entertainment, director of Digital Media for Starbucks Entertainment, and group product manager at Microsoft has positioned him for such game-changing moves. Primus, who received his bachelor’s and master’s in industrial engineering from Georgia Tech and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, will stay plugged into the latest tech developments: He’s also the chairman emeritus of the advisory board of top-ranked School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at his alma mater.\\n\\nDavid L. Steward\\n\\nChairman\\n\\nWorld Wide Technology\\n\\nThrough continuous innovation and forging partnerships with Cisco, Dell EMC, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard Enterprises and other tech giants, David L.

With $10.7 billion in 2017 revenues, WWT is the nation’s largest black-owned company and one of the biggest minority suppliers in the country.\\n\\nMaintaining that WWT is headquartered in “Silicon Valley in St. Louis,” Steward recently announced his company’s inclusion in Gartner’s August 2018 Market Guide for Digital Business Consulting Services “as one of the 20 Representative Vendors in DBCS across digital strategy, digital customer, and employee experience, and digital business model transformation.” To better serve customers, WWT created the Advanced Technology Center, a brick-and-mortar campus containing labs used for product demonstrations, proofs of concept, building reference architectures, and so much more.\\n\\nThe Clinton, Missouri, native started his career in sales before launching WWT with less than 10 employees—now, WWT has 4,000-plus employees. Steward holds a bachelor’s degree from Central Mission State University.\\n\\nTop Executives\\n\\nTy Ahmad-Taylor\\n\\nVice President, Product Marketing\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nWhen Tyrone “Ty” Ahmad-Taylor took on the position as Facebook’s vice president of Product Marketing, members of the leadership team viewed the addition as a “big win” for its monetization strategy. In his role, he leads a team of 300 professionals engaged in product management and strategy, go-to-market plans, and financial analysis to both the advertising engineering organization and financial analysis teams—vital to the tech leader that produced 2017 global revenues of $40.7 billion.\\n\\nWhen Facebook selected Ahmad-Taylor, the company recruited C-suite material: he previously held the position of president and CEO of THX Ltd, the innovative audio-visual company founded by Star Wars creator George Lucas. One of his groundbreaking projects was launching THX Live! during the debut of Beyoncé’s Formation World Tour. The Haverford College graduate with a B.S. in economics and an M.S. in journalism from Columbia University has also held the position of vice president of SmartTV Services at Samsung, directing global teams in the U.S. and Korea.

As CEO, Brown-Philpot has expanded the company’s footprint by expanding its Tasker pool to more than 60,000, raising growth capital, and developing business-building partnerships like the one it struck with tech behemoth Amazon. Last year, however, she closed a masterstroke of a deal: Swedish home products retailer Ikea acquired TaskRabbit, which now operates as an independent subsidiary. The transaction gave TaskRabbit additional resources and heightened global branding—it has already doubled its scope to 40 markets in the U.S.—while Ikea gained a much-needed digital platform and expertise. Synergies, however, are readily apparent as Ikea promotes the fact that Taskers are on hand to provide furniture assembly, among other services.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Brown-Philpot never envisioned being a part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem. The Detroit native started her professional career as an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers and then took a job as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. While working at the financial giant, she had the opportunity to work on tech deals. Intrigued by the growth in the industry and booming IPO activity, she attended Stanford Business School.

The self-described “broad and bipartisan group” encompasses voices from the state’s faith communities, colleges and universities, nonprofits, employers and more.\\n\\nMike Leppert, who serves as Indiana Forward’s campaign manager, and Mindi Goodpaster, United Way of Central Indiana’s vice president of public policy, are championing the effort, which includes support from the likes of Indiana giants Eli Lilly and Company, Salesforce Inc. and Cummins Inc. Its executive committee is dotted with names from the Indiana Youth Group, the Muslim Alliance of Indiana and the state’s American Civil Liberties Union.\\n\\nLeppert said Tuesday the coalition is pushing for specific language in the law that would protect people targeted on the basis of their race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation and that would push courts to further consider sentence aggravators or enhancements in such crimes. The group views these elements as “non-negotiable,” he added.\\n\\nA sentence aggravator would allow a judge to increase the severity of a sentence within a certain crime classification. This is determined if more than half of the evidence indicates an underlying motive, such as attacking a person because of their race.\\n\\nSentence enhancements are similar but allow the crime to be charged at a higher level, such as moving a charge from a Level 1 felony to a Level 2 felony. Such a decision must be determined beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\nIndiana currently provides a definition for bias crimes in general terms, noting any crime in which a person, group of people or property was harmed or damaged due to its association with a “color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation,” granting those involved in the judicial system a basis to determine aggravating factors.\\n\\nThe Indiana Supreme Court also determined in a 2003 case, Witmer v. State, that judges can consider a victim’s characteristics to justify an enhanced sentence. In this case, the court determined a murder victim, 17-year-old Sasezly Richardson, was targeted because she was black and used this conclusion to justify a longer sentence for the perpetrator, Alex Witmer.\\n\\nSen. Mike Young, R-Indianapolis, and former Senate President Pro Tem David Long, R-Fort Wayne, used this ruling and Indiana courts’ virtually limitless power in considering case evidence as justification for blocking last session’s hate crimes bill, which never received a vote.\\n\\nWhile Leppert agreed these powers exist, he said case decisions show they are rarely used.\\n\\n“What’s lacking is the state’s response to things that are illegal and intolerable,” Leppert said.\\n\\nGoodpaster and Leppert added the state has little to lose by enforcing Indiana Forward’s legislation, which can only be enacted when a crime occurs.\\n\\n“The biggest misconception is that we’re trying to control thoughts or beliefs. Someone has to commit a crime to be punished,” Goodpaster said. “It is not a crime to think or believe, but as soon as you commit a crime against a person, a group of people or their property, this law will affect you.”\\n\\n“If I were them, I would pass this as soon as possible,” Lepper added, noting that extended support from Gov. Eric Holcomb is placing considerable weight on Republican leaders in both chambers.\\n\\nHolcomb first called for legislation in a tweet this summer after a Jewish temple in Carmel, Congregation Shaarey Tefilla, was vandalized with anti-Semitic symbols. He further outlined the necessity of the law in his legislative agenda presented earlier this month, where he modeled his recommendation on the state’s existing workplace harassment prevention policy.\\n\\n“I fully appreciate the ‘where does the list stop’ discussion,” Holcomb said Tuesday, referring to prior hate crimes law debates. “However, we’ve had an employment policy in place in this office since 2005 that’s worked just fine, and so I didn’t want to take a step back from that.”\\n\\nThe harassment policy includes protections for all of the characteristics Indiana Forward wants included in a bias crimes law, as well as guidance for those harassed for their national origin, ancestry and veteran status.\\n\\n“It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s long overdue. I’ll take some responsibility for it not being checked off the list already,” Holcomb said.\\n\\nThe Indiana Forward website provides additional information about the group’s 2019 policy goals.
